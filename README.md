## Next.js Revalidate Bug

This is a minimal reproduction of a bug in Next.js where the `revalidate` option does not work as expected if using a middleware to rewrite the path to support multi-tenant applications such as the [Vercel Platforms](https://github.com/vercel/platforms) example. 

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
2. Run `npm run start` to start the production server.
3. Make a request to `http://abc.localhost:3000/`. Observe the `Cache-Control` header.

**Expected**: `s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=31532400`
**Actual**: `private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate`
